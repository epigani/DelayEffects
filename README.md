# DelayEffects
Code for generating data used in the paper ["Delay effects on the stability of large ecosystems"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2211449119).

## Requirements
The code is written in Python 3.7.4 and requires the following packages:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* seaborn
* tqdm
* joblib
* numba

## Usage
The code is organized in the following way:
* `main.py` contains the main function that runs the simulations and saves the data.
* `model.py` contains the model class that defines the model and the functions for running the simulations.
* `plot.py` contains the functions for plotting the results.
* `utils.py` contains the functions for generating the initial conditions and the functions for calculating the stability of the equilibrium points.
* `data/` contains the data generated by the simulations.
* `figures/` contains the figures generated by the code.

To run the simulations, use the following command:
```
python main.py
```
The code will generate the data and save it in the `data/` folder. The figures will be saved in the `figures/` folder.
